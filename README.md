The goal of the project is to develop a web application that predicts stock trends using the LSTM model. The application is built using Streamlit, a popular open-source library specifically designed for creating custom web applications in the field of machine learning and data science. The user-friendly interface and intuitive design of Streamlit make it an ideal choice for building this kind of application. The resulting application will allow users to easily input stock symbol and receive accurate trend predictions, all within a visually appealing and user-friendly web interface.
